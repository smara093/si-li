This is a simple list app built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Expo](https://expo.io/). It can be installed through the [Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) [here](https://expo.io/@fibina/simple-list).

The simple list app is meant to do the following:

- display a list of items where an item is a text
- add a new item
- remove an item by long press 
- display section of removed items at the bottom 
- items are ordered by last modified, descending

Stretch goals:
- add an undo option for reverting the previous action
- add the ability to reactivate an item from the inactive section
- add the ability to clear inactive items 
- prompt to clean up if the list of inactive items gets out of hand (configurable)
- add configuration menu
